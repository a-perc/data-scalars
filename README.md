# ‹data-scalars›

Automatic representation of a _scalar_ value as [Polymer Elements](https://elements.polymer-project.org) (Iron and Paper) – in either read-only or editable mode.

`‹data-scalars›` elements consume an immutable _data egg_ data structure and produce suitable Polymer elements to represent that value. The _data egg_ is a simple structure, which contains the _scalar_ value, its _type_ and _logical formatting hints_.

Designed to work hand-in-hand with _data nuggets_ data structures delivered by [`‹data-pipes›`](https://github.com/olange/data-pipes), although both can be used independently.
