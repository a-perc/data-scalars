# ‹data-scalars›

Automatic representation of immutable _scalar_ values as [Polymer Elements](https://elements.polymer-project.org) (Iron and Paper).

`‹data-scalars›` elements consume a _data egg_ data structure, containing a _scalar value_, its _type_ and _formatting hints_, and produces suitable Polymer elements to represent that value – in either read-only or editable mode.

Designed to work hand-in-hand with _data nuggets_ data structures delivered by [`‹data-pipes›`](https://github.com/olange/data-pipes), although both can be used independently.
